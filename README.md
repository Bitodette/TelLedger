# Telegram Finance Bot (Ledger/Paisa)

A privacy-focused Telegram bot designed to streamline personal finance tracking. It records expenses and income directly into a local **Ledger** text file (`.ledger` / `.journal`), making it fully compatible with **[Paisa](https://paisa.fyi)**.

## Features

- 100% Private & Local: Data is stored in a plain text file on your own machine. No third-party cloud storage.
- Instant Input: Record transactions via Telegram chat instantly. Supports offline/pending messages (syncs when the bot comes online).
- Auto-Sync: Automatically triggers Paisa to refresh its database (`paisa update`) upon recording a transaction.
- Dual Payment Mode:
  - Cash Mode: deducts from `Assets:Wallet:Cash`.
  - Digital Mode: deducts from `Assets:Bank:Main` (QRIS/Transfer).
- Security: Restricts access to a specific Telegram User ID.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Telegram Bot Token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- [Paisa](https://paisa.fyi) installed and added to your system PATH.

## Installation

### 1. Install Paisa (Visualization Dashboard)

This bot requires `paisa` to be installed to trigger the auto-sync feature.

[Follow the Official Installation Guide Here](https://paisa.fyi/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_1)

Make sure you can run `paisa --version` in your terminal before proceeding.

### 2. Setup the Bot

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bitodette/TelLedger.git
    cd TelLedger
    ```

2.  **Set up Virtual Environment** (Recommended)

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
    # venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Initialize Ledger File**
    Copy the sample ledger to create your real data file:

    ```bash
    cp sample.ledger finance.ledger
    ```

## Configuration

Open `finance_bot.py` and edit the **Configuration Section** at the top:

```python
# Telegram Bot Token (Get from @BotFather)
TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"

# Your Telegram User ID (Get from @userinfobot)
# Important: This prevents others from using your bot.
ALLOWED_USER_ID = 123456789

# Path to your Ledger File
LEDGER_FILE = "finance.ledger"

# Path to Paisa Config (Optional, for auto-sync)
PAISA_CONFIG_FILE = "paisa.yaml"
```

Run the bot:

```bash
python finance_bot.py

### Pro Tip: One-Command Launch (Linux)

You can create a simple script to launch both the Telegram Bot and Paisa Dashboard simultaneously.

Create a script file in your local bin directory:

```bash
nano ~/.local/bin/finance
```

Paste the following script (update PROJECT_DIR to your actual folder path):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# CONFIGURATION
PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/Projects/TelLedger"

# CLEANUP FUNCTION
cleanup() {
    echo ""
    echo "Shutting down Paisa and Bot..."
    if [[ -n "$PAISA_PID" ]]; then
        kill "$PAISA_PID" 2>/dev/null
    fi
    exit
}
trap cleanup SIGINT

# 1. START PAISA (BACKGROUND)
cd "$PROJECT_DIR" || { echo "Directory not found"; exit 1; }

echo "Starting Finance System..."
echo "Dashboard: http://localhost:7500"

# Run Paisa silently in background
paisa serve --config paisa.yaml > /dev/null 2>&1 &
PAISA_PID=$!

# 2. START BOT (FOREGROUND)
echo "Bot is active! Waiting for messages..."
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop."
echo "---------------------------------------"

# Activate venv and run bot
source venv/bin/activate
python finance_bot.py
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/finance
```

Usage: Now, you can simply type this command from any terminal window to start your entire finance system:

```bash
finance
```
